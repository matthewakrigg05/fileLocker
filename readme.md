This is a small project that I have decided to create in order to aid my 
productivity. The intention of the project is to applications so that they 
cannot run, encouraging me to focus on other things. This is something that 
I do personally use on a regular basis in order to prevent me from becoming
sidetracked during time that I dedicate to doing work. So far it has proven
quite useful as it has stopped me from trying to distract myself as often as 
well as improving my focus outside of working, such as with when I am reading.
