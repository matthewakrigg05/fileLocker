This is a small project that I have decided to create in order to aid my 
productivity. The intention of the project is to applications so that they 
cannot run, encouraging me to focus on other things. 

Some general ideas that I intend to implement are:
 - Lock files
 - Password protect unlocking early
 - Adding files to lockable groups e.g. games
 - Unlock files upon closing of the script (help if locked accidentally)
 - Allow them to be put on timers
 - Settings for locking e.g. times of day
