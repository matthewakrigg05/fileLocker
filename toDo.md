Some more ideas I intend to add:
 - ability to get all .exe files and choosing to make adding them easier and faster?
 - add a GUI
   - show a timer on the UI showing how long is left?
 - save lists of apps/sites that you wish to block?
 - make it so that you can unblock the apps early using a password or passphrase?
 - allow to enable time periods to block things eg during work hours?
 - go through main.py and make all methods available in the UI version
