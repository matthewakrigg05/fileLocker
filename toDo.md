Some more ideas I intend to add:
 - ability to get all .exe files and choosing to make adding them easier and faster
 - add a GUI
   - show a timer on the UI showing how long is left
 - save lists of apps/sites that you wish to block
 - make it so that you can unblock the apps early using a password or passphrase
 - unlock specific apps using a prompt and passcode
 - allow to enable time periods to block things eg during work hours 
 - once app is added, use checkboxes on UI to decide whether to block
 - make so that adding websites doesnt need new methods
