Some more ideas I intend to add:
 - ability to get all .exe files and choosing to make adding them easier and faster?
 - save lists of apps/sites that you wish to block?
 - allow to enable time periods to block things eg during work hours?
 - see if i can change the way the app asks for admin perms
 - amend UI elements to work with the new lists class
 - make it possible to get rid of the checkfiles and manipulate list files
